# Recipe-Preparation-Agent-IBM
An AI-powered assistant that suggests recipes based on available ingredients, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with IBM WatsonX. Supports substitutions, step-by-step cooking guidance, and dietary personalization. Built with LangGraph + ReAct architecture.

# 🍽️ Recipe Preparation Agent using IBM WatsonX AI

This project was developed as part of the **IBM Edunet Foundation Internship Program**.  
It aims to solve everyday cooking challenges by leveraging **WatsonX AI** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to build an intelligent, real-time recipe assistant.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters ingredients (e.g., “I have rice, onion, and tomato”)
2. WatsonX searches recipe documents using RAG
3. Agent replies with best-matching recipes, substitutions, and steps
4. All interactions are grounded in uploaded PDF knowledge files
